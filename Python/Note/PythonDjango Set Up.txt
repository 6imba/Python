install python ==> location : C:\Python3.9.4\python.exe
pip is also installed automatically ==> location : C:\Python3.9.4\Scripts\pip.exe

this is automatically done when we check add environament variable option while python installation time {
Add path in system variable(environmental variable) ,at top ==>
C:\Python3.9.4\Scripts\
C:\Python3.9.4\
}

python and pip version:
cmd : python --version
cmd : pip --version

upgrade pip :
cmd : python -m pip install --upgrade pip

Then install django
cmd : python -m pip install Django
cmd : python -m django --version

upgrade django:
pip install django --upgrade

Untill now 5/1/2021, here i have ==> 
python : 3.9.4
pip : 21.1.1
django :3.2



Now Create Project/project_folder using Pychar IDE:
1.> In pycharm create new project and give it name as myProject
i.e : C:\Users\SimbA\PycharmProjects\myProject

Note : not to check New environment. do check existing or previously configured interperter and select python 3.9
By default pycharm save its project in C:\Users\SimbA\PycharmProjects\ directory

Now use Django framework:
open terminal and cd to project_folder i.e myProject
# C:\Users\SimbA\PycharmProjects\myProject>

way to do currently you are in :
C:\Users\SimbA>
type cd Py
and press tab
it will give
C:\Users\SimbA>cd PycharmProjects
again type
\myProject
enter
finally
C:\Users\SimbA\PycharmProjects\myProject>
now see the dir inside myProject folder

#
C:\Users\SimbA\PycharmProjects\myProject>dir
 Volume in drive C has no label.
 Volume Serial Number is 1417-346A

 Directory of C:\Users\SimbA\PycharmProjects\myProject

05/01/2021  04:56 PM    <DIR>          .
05/01/2021  04:56 PM    <DIR>          ..
05/01/2021  05:03 PM    <DIR>          .idea
               0 File(s)              0 bytes
               3 Dir(s)  86,709,075,968 bytes free


Now its time to create danngo,
cmd : django-admin
django-admin is the utility that gives the list of sub command of django

#
C:\Users\SimbA\PycharmProjects\myProject>django-admin

Type 'django-admin help <subcommand>' for help on a specific subcommand.

    showmigrations
    sqlflush
    sqlmigrate
    sqlsequencereset
    squashmigrations
    startapp
    startproject
    test
    testserver
Note that only Django core commands are listed as settings are not properly configured (error: Requested setting INSTALLED_APPS, but settings are not configured. You must either define the environment variable DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE or call settings.configure() before accessing settings.).


#
Finally,
Now finally create Django project using command/utility(django-admin), sub_command_of_django(startproject) and project_name(myBook):
NOte : Never give project_name same as built_in_module_name
cmd : django-admin startproject myBook
C:\Users\SimbA\PycharmProjects\myProject>django-admin startproject myBook
Now see inside C:\Users\SimbA\PycharmProjects\myProject folder new project naed as myBook is created.

Now cd inside myBook project folder:
C:\Users\SimbA\PycharmProjects\myProject>cd myBook
gives,
C:\Users\SimbA\PycharmProjects\myProject\myBook>


Now see the directory inside myBook project folder:

C:\Users\SimbA\PycharmProjects\myProject\myBook>dir
 Volume in drive C has no label.
 Volume Serial Number is 1417-346A

 Directory of C:\Users\SimbA\PycharmProjects\myProject\myBook

05/01/2021  05:06 PM    <DIR>          .
05/01/2021  05:06 PM    <DIR>          ..
05/01/2021  05:06 PM               684 manage.py
05/01/2021  05:06 PM    <DIR>          myBook
               1 File(s)            684 bytes
               3 Dir(s)  86,707,916,800 bytes free






Now When you see inside Pycharm you see :
main_project_folder:
myProject
	Sub_folder:
	1).idea
	2)myBook // outer directory its jus a name of project, you can even change it
		inside myBook:
		1)myBook // name of our django project, main folder for coding project, what ever we import we use this project_folder name i.e : from myBook, This the python package with whom we aill be working.// see about python package in codewithharry
			inside_myBook:
			# __init__.py, asgi.py, setting.py, urls.py, wsgi.py

		2)manage.py // commandline utility that helps to interact with our django project

C:\Users\SimbA\PycharmProjects\myProject\myBook>cd myBook

C:\Users\SimbA\PycharmProjects\myProject\myBook\myBook>




now C:\Users\SimbA\PycharmProjects\myProject\myBook\myBook>cd ..
C:\Users\SimbA\PycharmProjects\myProject\myBook>
