# 1. What is a CSV:
    - CSV stands for “Comma Separated Values.”
    - It is the simplest file format for storing tabular_data(such as a spreadsheet or database) as in plain_text with .csv extension.
    - Each line of the file is a data record.
    - Each record consists of one or more fields, separated by commas.




# 2. So why do we need csv file ?
    - CSV files are used in data exchange.
        - Data exchange from excel file to database file.
        - Like, if I have a excel_worksheet and i want to send all the data from that excel_worksheet to the database_software.
        - Directly exchange of data is not possible because database_software doesn't accepts excel_file so we use csv formate.
        - So first we need to convert excel_file(.xlsx) into CSB_file(.csv) & then send this CSV_file(.csv) to database_software(MySQL, openOffice calc).
    - It is important to know to work with CSV because we mostly rely on CSV data in our day-to-day lives as data scientists.



# 3. Ways to create CSV file from excel_file|database_table_file:



# 4. Structure of CSV:
        Id, Name, Age   #(Header)
        1, Amir, 22     #(Observations/records)
        2, Lina, 12     #(Observations/records)
        3, Homo, 100    #(Observations/records)



# 5. Ways for Handling CSV file:
    - using python file handling/inbulit open method/ file_object. (open())
    - using python local/inbulit module call csv. (import csv)
    - using python external module call pandas. (1. pip install pandas, 2.import pandas)



# 6. Manipulating csv-data.
    - Read
    - Write
