# #We will now use this file as input in a program that will do some data processing. In the program, we will examine each line of the file and 
# print it with some additional text. Because readlines() returns a list of lines of text, we can use the for loop to iterate through each line 
# of the file.

# #A line of a file is defined to be a sequence of characters up to and including a special character called the newline character. If you
#  evaluate a string that contains a newline character you will see the character represented as \n. If you print a string that contains a 
# newline you will not see the \n, you will just see its effects (a carriage return).

# #As the for loop iterates through each line of the file the loop variable will contain the current line of the file as a string of characters.
#  The general pattern for processing each line of a text file

# #To process all of our olypmics data, we will use a for loop to iterate over the lines of the file. Using the split method, we can break each
#  line into a list containing all the fields of interest about the athlete. We can then take the values corresponding to name, team and event
#  to construct a simple sentence.

# #To make the code a little simpler, and to allow for more efficient processing, Python provides a built-in way to iterate through the contents
#  of a file one line at a time, without first reading them all into a list. Some students find this confusing initially, so we donâ€™t recommend
#  doing it this way, until you get a little more comfortable with Python. But this idiom is preferred by Python programmers, so you should be
#  prepared to read it. And when you start dealing with big files, you may notice the efficiency gains of using it.
