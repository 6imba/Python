Introduction¶
Computers are often used to automate repetitive tasks. Repeating identical or similar tasks without making errors is something that computers do well and people do poorly.

Repeated execution of a sequence of statements is called iteration. Because iteration is so common, Python provides several language features to make it easier. We’ve already seen the for statement in a previous chapter. This is a very common form of iteration in Python. In this chapter we are going to look at the while statement — another way to have your program do iteration.

14.1.1. Learning Goals
To understand indefinite iteration

To solve problems involving convergence

14.1.2. Objectives
To apply the while loop for indefinite iteration

To be able to identify while loops that are likely to be infinite loops









What is for loop in Python?
The for loop in Python is used to iterate over a sequence (list, tuple, string) or other iterable objects. Iterating over a sequence is called traversal.

for_Loop:(finite loop)
Syntax of for Loop
for val in sequence:
	Body of for
Here, val is the variable that takes the value of the item inside the sequence on each iteration.

Loop continues until we reach the last item in the sequence. The body of for loop is separated from the rest of the code using indentation.
