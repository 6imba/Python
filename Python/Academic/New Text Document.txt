Lists, tuples, and strings have been called sequences, because their items occur in order. The dictionary is the first compound type that we've seen that is not a sequence, so we can't index or slice a dictionary.



sequence => list, tuples, string
mutable_sequence  = list
immutable_sequence   = tuples, string
