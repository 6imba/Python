You have seen examples of creating types that are more complicated or specific than the ones built in to Python (like lists or strings). Turtle, with all the instance variables and methods you learned about using earlier in the semester, is a class that programmers defined which is now included in the Python language. In this chapter, we defined Point with some functionality that can make it easier to write programs that involve x,y coordinate Point instances. And shortly, you’ll see how you can define classes to represent objects in a game.\n",

    "# What information should each instance have as instance variables? This is related to what an instance represents. See if you can make it into a sentence. “Each instance represents one < song > and each < song > has an < artist > and a < title > as instance variables.” Or, “Each instance represents a < Tweet > and each < Tweet > has a < user (who posted it) > and < a message content string > as instance variables.”\n",
    "\n",
    "# What instance methods should each instance have? What should each instance be able to do? To continue using the same examples: Maybe each song has a method that uses a lyrics API to get a long string of its lyrics. Maybe each song has a method that returns a string of its artist’s name. Or for a tweet, maybe each tweet has a method that returns the length of the tweet’s message. (Go wild!)\n",
