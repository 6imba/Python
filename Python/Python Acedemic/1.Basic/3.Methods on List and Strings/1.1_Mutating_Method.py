# return value in methods
# #It is important to remember that methods like append, sort, and reverse all return None. 


#Youâ€™ve seen some methods already, like the count and index methods. Methods are either mutating or non-mutating. Mutating methods are ones that change the object after the method has been used. Non-mutating methods do not change the object after the method has been used.
#The count and index methods are both non-mutating. 
#The dot operator can also be used to access built-in methods of list objects. append
