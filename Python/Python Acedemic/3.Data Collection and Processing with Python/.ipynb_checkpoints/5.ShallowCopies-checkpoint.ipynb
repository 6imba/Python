    "# Deep and Shallow Copies\n",
    "# Earlier when we discussed cloning and aliasing lists we had mentioned that simply cloning a list using [:] would take care of any issues with having two lists unintentionally connected to each other. That was definitely true for making shallow copies (copying a list at the highest level), but as we get into nested data, and nested lists in particular, the rules become a bit more complicated. We can have second-level aliasing in these cases, which means we need to make deep copies.\n",
    "# When you copy a nested list, you do not also get copies of the internal lists. This means that if you perform a mutation operation on one of the original sublists, the copied version will also change. We can see this happen in the following nested list, which only has two levels.\n",
