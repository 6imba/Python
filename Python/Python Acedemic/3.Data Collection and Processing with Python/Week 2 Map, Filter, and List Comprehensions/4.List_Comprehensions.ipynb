    "# Hi everyone. I have to apologize because the previous lesson forced you to learn some pretty conceptually challenging\n",
    "# stuff, passing a transformer function to the map function, and passing a filtration function to the filter function. \n",
    "# It turns out that you wont actually use them. Python Programmers rarely do. \n",
    "# It was just a pedagogical tool to give you a way to really think through the map and filter programming patterns. \n",
    "# In Python, there's actually a simpler syntax for doing the map and filter patterns and even for combining them. \n",
    "# It's called list comprehensions. Now that you understand what they're for, I think you're going to love them. \n",
    "# The syntax can be a little confusing because it reuses elements of the for loop syntax. \n",
    "# But with an understanding of what list comprehensions do based on the map and filter lesson, I think you'll find that it's pretty intuitive. \n",
    "# List comprehensions are how Python programmers typically write code that does transformation and filtration. \n",
    "# At the end of this lesson, you should be able to read and write list comprehensions, and you should be able to describe \n",
    "# a list comprehension in terms of the transformation and filtration operations that it's performing. \n",
    "# So, let's go see how they work. See you at the end.\n"
