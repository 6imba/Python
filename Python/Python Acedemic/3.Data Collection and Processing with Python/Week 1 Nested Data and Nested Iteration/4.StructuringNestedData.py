# # When constructing your own nested data, it is a good idea to keep the structure consistent across each level. 
# For example, if you have a list of dictionaries, then each dictionary should have the same structure, meaning the 
# same keys and the same type of value associated with a particular key in all the dictionaries. The reason for this 
# is because any deviation in the structure that is used will require extra code to handle those special cases.
#  The more the structure deviates, the more you will have to use special cases.
# # For example, letâ€™s reconsider this nested iteration, but suppose not all the items in the outer list are lists.
# # Now the nested iteration fails.


# mainlist = [1,2,['a','b','c'],'apple',[11,22,33]]
# for sublist in mainlist:
#     print('Level1 : ',sublist)
#     for subs in sublist:#error as sublist+>1 int is not itereble
#         print('Level2 : ',subs)


# # We can solve this with special casing, a conditional that checks the type.

# mainlist = [1,2,['a','b','c'],'apple',[11,22,33]]
# for sublist in mainlist:
#     print('Level1 : ',sublist)
#     if type(sublist) is list:
#         for subs in sublist:# if iteration variable is list
#             print('    Level2 : ',subs)


# mainlist = [1,2,['a','b','c'],'apple',[11,22,33]]
# for sublist in mainlist:
#     print('Level1 : ',sublist)
#     if type(sublist) is int:#if iteration variable is int
